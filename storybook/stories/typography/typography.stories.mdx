<h1>Typography</h1>

<h2>Font</h2>
<p>
  We use the{' '}
  <a
    href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato"
    rel="noreferrer noopener"
    target="_blank"
  >
    Lato
  </a>{' '}
  Google font.
</p>

<h2>Headings</h2>
<p>Write all headings in sentence case.</p>
<p>
  Use heading tags, such as <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> and
  so on, to tag the headings on a page. Apply a heading class, such as{' '}
  <code>govie-heading-l</code>, to style them visually. Style headings
  consistently to create a clear content structure throughout your service.
</p>
<p>
  For a question page, or pages with long headings, start with{' '}
  <code>govie-heading-l</code>
  for an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>govie-heading-m</code> for an <code>
    &lt;h2&gt;
  </code> and so on. But change it if your pages feel unbalanced – the heading class
  you use does not always need to correspond to the heading level.
</p>

<CodeExample
  code={`
<h1 class="govie-heading-l">govie-heading-l</h1>
<h2 class="govie-heading-m">govie-heading-m</h2>
<h3 class="govie-heading-s">govie-heading-s</h3>`}
/>

<p>
  If your page has lots of long form content, start with{' '}
  <code>govie-heading-xl</code> for an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>,{' '}
  <code>govie-heading-l</code> for an <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, and so on.
</p>

<h3>Heading with captions</h3>
<p>
  Sometimes you may need to make it clear that a page is part of a larger
  section or group. To do this, you can use a heading with a caption above it.
</p>

<CodeExample
  code={`
<span class="govie-caption-xl">govie-caption-xl</span>
<h1 class="govie-heading-xl">govie-heading-xl</h1>
<span class="govie-caption-l">govie-caption-l</span>
<h1 class="govie-heading-l">govie-heading-l</h1>
<span class="govie-caption-m">govie-caption-m</span>
<h1 class="govie-heading-m">govie-heading-m</h1>`}
/>

<p>
  If the caption should be considered part of the page heading, you can also
  nest the caption within the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>.
</p>

<CodeExample
  code={`
<h1 class="govie-heading-l">
  <span class="govie-caption-l">govie-caption-l</span>
  govie-heading-l
</h1>`}
/>

<h2>Paragraphs</h2>
<h3>Body</h3>
<p>
  The default paragraph font size is 19px on large screens and 16px on small
  screens.
</p>

<CodeExample code={`<p class="govie-body">govie-body</p>`} />

<p>
  You can also add classes to create a lead paragraph or smaller body copy to
  convey hierarchy in your page.
</p>

<h3>Lead paragraph</h3>
<p>
  A lead paragraph is an introductory paragraph that you can use at the top of a
  page to summarise the content. Lead paragraphs use 24px type on desktop and
  should only be used once per page if needed.
</p>

<CodeExample code={`<p class="govie-body-l">govie-body-l</p>`} />

<h3>Body small</h3>
<p>
  You can use the <code>govie-body-s</code> class sparingly to make your
  paragraph font size smaller: 16px on larger screens and 14px on smaller
  screens.
</p>

<p>
  The majority of your body copy should use the standard 19px paragraph size.
</p>

<CodeExample code={`<p class="govie-body-s">govie-body-s</p>`} />

<h2>Text alignment override classes</h2>
<p>
  If you need to align text differently to how it usually displays on the page,
  you can use text alignment override classes. Use:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <code>govie-!-text-align-left</code> to align text to the left
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>govie-!-text-align-right</code> to align text to the right
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>govie-!-text-align-centre</code> to align text to the centre
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  You should usually left-align body copy that’s read left to right.
  Right-aligned body copy can be hard for users to find and read when they
  magnify their screen.
</p>
<p>
  Do not ‘justify’ blocks of body copy so that they’re aligned to both the left
  and right margins. Doing this creates wider spaces between words, which can
  make the text hard to read.
</p>

<h2>Font override classes</h2>
<p>
  You might need to set the font size or font weight of an element outside of
  the predefined heading and paragraph classes. For this you can use the font
  override classes in your HTML or reference the typography mixins in your own
  components.
</p>

<h3>Font size</h3>
<p>
  The full gov.ie typography scale goes from 14px up to 80px on large screens.
  You can add these font size override classes to any other typographic class or
  element and they will change the font size.
</p>

<CodeExample
  code={`
<p class="govie-body govie-!-font-size-80">govie-!-font-size-80</p>
<p class="govie-body govie-!-font-size-48">govie-!-font-size-48</p>
<p class="govie-body govie-!-font-size-36">govie-!-font-size-36</p>
<p class="govie-body govie-!-font-size-27">govie-!-font-size-27</p>
<p class="govie-body govie-!-font-size-24">govie-!-font-size-24</p>
<p class="govie-body govie-!-font-size-19">govie-!-font-size-19</p>
<p class="govie-body govie-!-font-size-16">govie-!-font-size-16</p>
<p class="govie-body govie-!-font-size-14">govie-!-font-size-14</p>`}
/>

<h3>Font weight</h3>
<p>
  As with the font size, you can add a font weight override class to any other
  typographic class or element to change the font weight to regular or bold
  weight.
</p>

<CodeExample
  code={`
<p class="govie-body govie-!-font-weight-regular">govie-!-font-weight-regular</p>
<p class="govie-body govie-!-font-weight-bold">govie-!-font-weight-bold</p>`}
/>

<h4>Bold text</h4>
<p>
  You can use bold to emphasise particular words in a transaction. Use it to
  highlight critical information that users need to refer to or you’ve seen them
  miss.
</p>
<p>
  For example, “Your reference number is <strong>ABC12345678</strong>. Use this
  to track your application. Updates will be sent to{' '}
  <strong>name@example.com</strong>“
</p>
<p>
  Use bold sparingly. Overuse will make it difficult for users to know which
  parts of your content they need to pay the most attention to.
</p>

<h2>Links</h2>
<p>
  Links are blue and underlined by default. If your link is at the end of a
  sentence or paragraph, make sure that the linked text does not include the
  full stop.
</p>

<CodeExample
  code={`<p class="govie-body">Jump to <a href="#" class="govie-link">HTML example</a>.</p>`}
/>

<p>
  Use the <code>govie-link--no-visited-state</code> modifier class where it is
  not helpful to distinguish between visited and unvisited states, for example
  when linking to pages with frequently-changing content such as the dashboard
  for an admin interface.
</p>
<CodeExample
  code={`<a href="#" class="govie-link govie-link--no-visited-state">link text (with no visited state)</a>`}
/>

<h3>External links</h3>
<p>
  If it’s an external link to a non-government website, make that clear in the
  link text. For example, ‘read advice on writing link text from [name of
  organisation]’. There’s no need to say explicitly that you’re linking to an
  external site.
</p>

<h3>Opening links in a new tab</h3>
<p>
  Avoid opening links in a new tab or window. It can be disorienting - and{' '}
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G200.html">
    can cause accessibility problems for people who cannot visually perceive
    that the new tab has opened
  </a>
  .
</p>

<p>
  If you need a link to open in a new tab - for example, to stop the user losing
  information they’ve entered into a form - then include the words ‘opens in new
  tab’ as part of the link. There’s no need to say ‘tab or window’, since
  opening in a new tab is the default behaviour for most browsers.
</p>

<p>
  Include <code>rel="noreferrer noopener"</code> along with{' '}
  <code>target="_blank"</code> to reduce the risk of{' '}
  <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Reverse_Tabnabbing">
    reverse tabnabbing
  </a>
  . The following example shows how to do this in HTML.
</p>

<CodeExample
  code={`<a href="#" class="govie-link" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">link text (opens in new tab)</a>`}
/>

<p>
  If you’re displaying lots of links together and want to save space and avoid
  repetition, consider doing both of the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    adding a line of text before the links saying ‘The following links open in a
    new tab’
  </li>
  <li>
    including{' '}
    <code>
      &lt;span class="govie-visually-hidden"&gt; (opens in new tab)
      &lt;/span&gt;
    </code>{' '}
    as part of the link text, so that part of the link text is visually hidden
    but still accessible to screen readers
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Links on dark backgrounds</h3>
<p>
  Use the <code>govie-link--inverse</code> modifier class to show white links on
  dark backgrounds — for example, in headers, custom components, and patterns
  with darker backgrounds.
</p>
<p>
  Make sure all users can see the links — the white links and background colour{' '}
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html">
    must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1
  </a>
  .
</p>

<CodeExample
  code={`<a href="#" class="govie-link govie-link--inverse">link text (on dark background)</a>`}
  darkMode
/>

<h3>Links without underlines</h3>
<p>
  Use the <code>govie-link--underline</code> modifier class to remove underlines
  from links.
</p>
<p>
  Only do this if the context tells the user that the text is a link, even
  without the underline.
</p>

<p>
  For example, links in a header or side navigation might not need underlines.
  Users will understand that they’re links because of where they are, at the
  same place, across different pages.
</p>

<CodeExample
  code={`<a href="#" class="govie-link govie-link--no-underline">link text (with no underline)</a>`}
/>

<h2>Lists</h2>
<p>
  Use lists to make blocks of text easier to read, and to break information into
  manageable chunks.
</p>

<CodeExample
  code={`
<ul class="govie-list">
  <li>
    <a class="govie-link" href="#">Benefits calculators</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a class="govie-link" href="#">Benefit overpayments</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a class="govie-link" href="#">Benefit fraud</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a class="govie-link" href="#">More</a>
  </li>
</ul>`}
/>

<h3>Bulleted lists</h3>
<p>
  Introduce bulleted lists with a lead-in line ending in a colon. Start each
  item with a lowercase letter, and do not use a full stop at the end.
</p>

<CodeExample
  code={`
<p class="govie-body">You can buy:</p>
<ul class="govie-list govie-list--bullet">
  <li>apples</li>
  <li>oranges</li>
  <li>pears</li>
</ul>`}
/>

<h3>Numbered lists</h3>
<p>
  Use numbered lists instead of bulleted lists when the order of the items is
  relevant.
</p>

<p>
  You do not need to use a lead-in line for numbered lists. Items in a numbered
  list should end in a full stop because each should be a complete sentence.
</p>

<CodeExample
  code={`
<ol class="govie-list govie-list--number">
  <li>Delivery address.</li>
  <li>Payment.</li>
  <li>Confirmation.</li>
</ol>`}
/>

<h3>Adding extra spacing between list items</h3>
<p>
  If a list is hard to read because the items run across multiple lines you can
  add extra spacing.
</p>
<CodeExample
  code={`
<p class="govie-body">You will have to apply the reverse charge if you supply any of these services:</p>
<ul class="govie-list govie-list--bullet govie-list--spaced">
  <li>
    constructing, altering, repairing, extending, demolishing or dismantling buildings or structures (whether permanent or not), including offshore installation services
  </li>
  <li>
    constructing, altering, repairing, extending, demolishing of any works forming, or planned to form, part of the land, including (in particular) walls, roadworks, power lines, electronic communications equipment, aircraft runways, railways, inland waterways, docks and harbours
  </li>
  <li>
    pipelines, reservoirs, water mains, wells, sewers, industrial plant and installations for purposes of land drainage, coast protection or defence
  </li>
  <li>
    installing heating, lighting, air-conditioning, ventilation, power supply, drainage, sanitation, water supply or fire protection systems in any building or structure
  </li>
  <li>
    internal cleaning of buildings and structures, so far as carried out in the course of their construction, alteration, repair, extension or restoration
  </li>
  <li>
    painting or decorating the inside or the external surfaces of any building or structure
  </li>
  <li>
    services which form an integral part of, or are part of the preparation or completion of the services described above - including site clearance, earth-moving, excavation, tunnelling and boring, laying of foundations, erection of scaffolding, site restoration, landscaping and the provision of roadways and other access works
  </li>
</ul>
`}

<h2>Section break</h2>
<p>
  You can use the <code>govie-section-break</code> classes on an{' '}
  <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> element to create a thematic break between sections of
  content.
  <code>govie-section-break</code> has class-based modifiers for different size margins.
</p>

<p>
  By default <code>govie-section-break</code> is only visible by its margin. You
  can add the <code>govie-section-break--visible</code> class to make it visible
  with a separator line.
</p>
<CodeExample
  code={`
<hr class="govie-section-break govie-section-break--xl govie-section-break--visible">
<hr class="govie-section-break govie-section-break--l govie-section-break--visible">
<hr class="govie-section-break govie-section-break--m govie-section-break--visible">
<hr class="govie-section-break govie-section-break--visible">`}
/>
