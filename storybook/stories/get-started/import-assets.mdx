# Import CSS, assets and JavaScript

## CSS

### Import all the CSS

To import all the Sass rules from Gov IE Frontend, add the following to your Sass file:

```sass
@import "@ogcio/ogcio-ds/govie/all";
```

### Import specific parts of the CSS

If you want to improve how quickly your service's pages load in browsers, you can import only the Sass rules you need.

- Import `@ogcio/ogcio-ds/govie/base` in your Sass file.
- Import the parts of the CSS you need.

For example, add the following to your Sass file to import the CSS you need for a basic Gov IE Frontend page.

```sass
@import "@ogcio/ogcio-ds/govie/base";\n
@import "@ogcio/ogcio-ds/govie/core/all";
@import "@ogcio/ogcio-ds/govie/objects/all";
@import "@ogcio/ogcio-ds/govie/components/footer";
@import "@ogcio/ogcio-ds/govie/components/header";
@import "@ogcio/ogcio-ds/govie/components/skip-link";
@import "@ogcio/ogcio-ds/govie/utilities/all";
@import "@ogcio/ogcio-ds/govie/overrides/all";
```

You can remove lines that import parts of the CSS you do not need.

### Import an individual component's CSS using a single import

You can also import a component and all its dependencies without importing `@ogcio/ogcio-ds/govie/base` first.

To import the button component for example, add the following to your Sass file:

```sass
@import "@ogcio/ogcio-ds/govie/components/button/button";
```

### Override with your own CSS

If you want to override Gov IE Frontend styles with your own styles, `@import` Gov IE Frontend styles before your own Sass rules.

<h2 id="fonts-and-images-assets">Font and image assets</h2>

To use the font and image assets from Gov IE Frontend, you can either:

- serve the assets from the Gov IE Frontend assets folder - recommended
- copy the font and image files into your application

### Serve the assets from the Gov IE Frontend assets folder - recommended

Set up your routing so that requests for files in `<YOUR-SITE-URL>/assets` are served from `/node_modules/@ogcio/ogcio-ds/govie/assets`.

For example if you're using [express.js](https://expressjs.com/), add the following to your `app.js` file:

```javascript
var path = require('path');
app.use(
  '/assets',
  express.static(path.join(__dirname, '@ogcio/ogcio-ds/govie/assets')),
);
```

### Copy the font and image files into your application

If you decide to copy the assets instead, copy the:

- `/node_modules/@ogcio/ogcio-ds/govie/assets/images` folder to `<YOUR-APP>/assets/images`
- `/node_modules/@ogcio/ogcio-ds/govie/assets/fonts` folder to `<YOUR-APP>/assets/fonts`

You should use an automated task or your build pipeline to copy the files, so your project folder stays up to date when we update Gov IE Frontend.

#### If you have your own folder structure

If you use a different folder structure than `<YOUR-APP>/assets/images` and `<YOUR-APP>/assets/fonts`, you can set Sass variables so that Sass builds the CSS to point to your folders.

Set one of the following before the `@import` line in your Sass file:

- `$govie-assets-path`
- `$govie-images-path` and `$govie-fonts-path`

Set the `$govie-assets-path` variable if your `font` and `image` folders have the same parent folder. For example:

```sass
$govie-assets-path: "/<YOUR-ASSETS-FOLDER>/";
```

Set the `$govie-images-path` and `$govie-fonts-path` variables if your `font` and `image` folders have different parent folders. For example:

```sass
$govie-images-path: "/<YOUR-IMAGES-FOLDER>/";
$govie-fonts-path: "/<YOUR-FONTS-FOLDER>/";
```

You can also use your own function to generate paths, for example if you're using `asset-pipeline` in [sass-rails](https://github.com/rails/sass-rails). Set the `$govie-image-url-function` and `$govie-font-url-function` variables to the name of your function.

<h2 id="import-javascript">JavaScript</h2>

To import the JavaScript from Gov IE Frontend, you can either:

- add Gov IE Frontend's JavaScript file to your HTML
- import JavaScript using a bundle

  r

### Add the JavaScript file to your HTML

If you decide to add the JavaScript to your HTML, first either:

- set up your routing so that requests for the JavaScript file are served from `node_modules/@ogcio/ogcio-ds/govie/all.js`
- copy the `node_modules/@ogcio/ogcio-ds/govie/all.js` file into your application

Then import the JavaScript file before the closing `</body>` tag of your HTML page or page template, and run the `initAll` function to initialise all the components.

```html
<body>
  ...
  <script src="<YOUR-APP>/<YOUR-JS-FILE>.js"></script>
  <script>
    window.GOVIEFrontend.initAll();
  </script>
</body>
```

#### Select and initialise an individual component

You can select and initialise a specific component by using its `data-module` attribute. For example, use `govie-radios` to initialise the first radio component on a page:

```javascript
<script>
  var Radios = window.GOVIEFrontend.Radios var $radio =
  document.querySelector('[data-module="govie-radios"]') if ($radio){' '}
  {new Radios($radio).init()}
</script>
```

### Import JavaScript using a bundler

If you decide to import using a bundler, we recommend you use `import` to only import the JavaScript for components you're using in your service. For example:

```javascript
import { SkipLink, Radios } from '@ogcio/ogcio-ds';

var $skipLink = document.querySelector('[data-module="govie-skip-link"]');
if ($skipLink) {
  new SkipLink($skipLink).init();
}

var $radios = document.querySelectorAll('[data-module="govie-radios]');
if ($radios) {
  for (var i = 0; i < $radios.length; i++) {
    new Radios($radios[i]).init();
  }
}
```

If you need to import all of Gov IE Frontend components, then run the `initAll` function to initialise them:

```javascript
import { initAll } from '@ogcio/ogcio-ds';
initAll();
```

If you're using a bundler that uses CommonJS like [Browserify](http://browserify.org/), you should use `require`:

```javascript
const GOVIEFrontend = require('@ogcio/ogcio-ds');
GOVIEFrontend.initAll();
```

### Select and initialise part of a page

If you update a page with new markup, for example a modal dialogue box, you can run `initAll` with a `scope` parameter to initialise the components on part of a page.

For example:

```html
<script>
  var $modal = document.querySelector('.modal');
  window.GOVIEFrontend.initAll({
    scope: $modal,
  });
</script>
```

### If your JavaScript is not working properly

If your site has a Content Security Policy (CSP), the CSP may block the inline JavaScript in the page template. You may see a warning like the following in your browser's developer tools:

```
Refused to execute inline script because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "default-src 'self'".
```

To unblock inline JavaScript, do one of the following:

- include a hash (recommended)
- use a nonce

Make sure you [understand the security implications of using either option](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/#security-considerations), as wrong implementation could affect your service's security. If you're not sure what to do, talk to a security expert.

#### Use a hash to unblock inline JavaScript

You can unblock inline JavaScript by including the following hash in your CSP:

```
sha256-+6WnXIl4mbFTCARd8N3COQmT3bJJmo32N8q8ZSQAIcU=
```

You do not need to make any changes to the HTML. [Learn more about Content Security Policy on the MDN Web Docs website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP).

#### Use a `nonce` attribute to unblock inline JavaScript

If you're unable to use the hash in your CSP, you can also use a `nonce` on inline JavaScript.

However, you should provide a nonce that hostile actors cannot guess. Otherwise, they could easily find a way around your CSP. You should use a value which is:

- unique for each HTTP response
- generated using a cryptographically-secure random generator
- at least 32 characters for hex, or 24 characters for base64

Make sure your script tags do not have any untrusted or unescaped variables.
