<h1>Update using Node.js package manager (npm)</h1>
<p>
  You can update with Node.js package manager (npm) if you [originally installed
  OGCIO-DS with npm](/?path=/docs/docs-install-with-npm--page).
</p>

<h2>Find out which version you're using</h2>
<p>To find out which version of OGCIO-DS your project is using, you can run:</p>
<CodeSnippet code="npm list @ogcio/ogcio-ds" />
<p>
  If you do not have command line access, you can see the version number in the{' '}
  <code>package.json</code> file in the root of your project directory. For
  example:
</p>

<CodeSnippet code={`"@ogcio/ogcio-ds": "0.0.8"`} />

<h2>Update OGCIO-DS using npm</h2>
<p>
  To find out the latest version of OGCIO-DS, check the{' '}
  <a
    href="https://github.com/ogcio/ogcio-ds/releases"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"
  >
    release notes
  </a>{' '}
  in the OGCIO-DS GitHub repository.
</p>
<p>
  You may need to make code changes to keep OGCIO-DS working in your project, if
  the major version number changes when you update. The major version number is
  the first digit in the version number.
</p>
<p>To update to the most recent version, run:</p>
<CodeSnippet code="npm install @ogcio/ogcio-ds@latest" />
<p>
  If you want to install an earlier version, replace <code>latest</code> with
  the version that you want to update to. For example:
</p>
<CodeSnippet code="npm install @ogcio/ogcio-ds@0.0.7" />
