## Install with Node.js package manager (npm)

### Requirements

1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. `cd` to the root of your project and check if you have a `package.json` file. If you do not have the file, create it by running:

```
npm init
```

3. Install the Gov IE Frontend package

```
npm install @ogcio/ogcio-ds --save
```

When the installation finishes, the `@ogcio/ogcio-ds` package will be in your `node_modules` folder.

You should now get started by [getting the CSS, assets and JavaScript working](?path=/docs/docs-get-started--docs) with one gov.ie Frontend component.

## Update using Node.js package manager (npm)

You can update with Node.js package manager (npm) if you originally installed Gov IE Frontend with npm (mentioned above).

### Find out which version you're using

To find out which version of Gov IE Frontend your project is using, you can run:

```
npm list @ogcio/ogcio-ds
```

If you do not have command line access, you can see the version number in the `package.json` file in the root of your project directory. For example:

```json
"@ogcio/ogcio-ds": "0.0.8"
```

## Update Gov IE Frontend using npm

To find out the latest version of Gov IE Frontend, check the [release notes](https://github.com/ogcio/ogcio-ds/releases) in the Gov IE Frontend GitHub repository.

You may need to make code changes to keep Gov IE Frontend working in your project, if the major version number changes when you update. The major version number is the first digit in the version number.

To update to the most recent version, run:

```
npm install @ogcio/ogcio-ds@latest
```

If you want to install an earlier version, replace `latest` with the version that you want to update to. For example:

```
npm install @ogcio/ogcio-ds@0.0.7
```
