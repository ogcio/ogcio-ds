<h1>Install with Node.js package manager (npm)</h1>
<h2>Requirements</h2>

1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. `cd` to the root of your project and check if you have a `package.json` file. If you do not have the file, create it by running:

```
npm init
```

3. Install the OGCIO-DS package

```
npm install @ogcio/ogcio-ds --save
```

When the installation finishes, the `@ogcio/ogcio-ds` package will be in your `node_modules` folder.

You should now get started by <Link textToDisplay='getting the CSS, assets and JavaScript working' href='?path=/docs/docs-get-started--docs' /> with one gov.ie Frontend component.
