# Get started

Get one Gov IE DS component working in your application, so you can test everything works before you add more components or styles.

You will need to do all the following steps to get your component working.

1. Install Gov IE DS package.
2. Add the HTML for a component to your application.
3. Get the CSS working.
4. Get the font and images working.
5. Get the JavaScript working.

## 1. Install Gov IE DS package

- You can <Link href="?path=/docs/docs-install-with-npm--docs">install Gov IE DS using npm</Link>.

- If you've <Link href='?path=/story/docs-install-using-precompiled-files--docs'>installed using precompiled files</Link>, get started with a <Link href='?path=/story/docs-install-using-precompiled-files--docs#basic-example-page'>a basic page instead</Link>.

## 2. Add the HTML for a component to your application

- Go to the <Link href='?path=/docs/typography-accordion--default'>example accordion component</Link>.

- Paste the HTML into a page or template in your application.

## 3. Get the CSS working

1. Add the following to the main Sass file in your project, so your Sass compiler adds all of Gov IE DS styles to your CSS file.

```sass
@import '@ogcio/ogcio-ds/govie/all';
```

2. Add your CSS file to your page layout if you need to. For example:

```html
<head>
  ...
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="<YOUR-CSS-FILE>.css" />
</head>
```

Run your application and check that the accordion displays correctly.

The accordion will use a generic font until you get the font and images working, and will not be interactive until you get the JavaScript working.

There are also different ways you can <Link href='?path=/docs/docs-import-css-assets-and-javascript--docs'>import Gov IE DS CSS</Link>.

## 4. Get the font and images working

Your component will not use the right font or images until you've added Gov IE DS assets to your application.

1. Copy the following 2 folders:

- `/node_modules/@ogcio/ogcio-ds/govie/assets/images` folder to `<YOUR-APP>/assets/images`
- `/node_modules/@ogcio/ogcio-ds/govie/assets/fonts` folder to `<YOUR-APP>/assets/fonts`

Run your application, then use [the Fonts tab in Firefox Page Inspector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector/How_to/Edit_fonts#The_Fonts_tab) to check the accordion is using the Lato font.

In your live application, we recommend <Link href='?path=/docs/docs-import-css-assets-and-javascript--docs#fonts-and-images-assets'>using an automated task or your build pipeline</Link> instead of copying the files manually.

## 5. Get the JavaScript working

1. Add the following to the top of the `<body>` section of your page template:

```javascript
<script>
  document.body.className = ((document.body.className) ? document.body.className
  + ' js-enabled' : 'js-enabled');
</script>
```

Copy the `/node_modules/@ogcio/ogcio-ds/govie/all.js` file to `<YOUR-JAVASCRIPT-FOLDER>/ogcio-ds.js`.

Import the file before the closing `</body>` tag of your page template, then run the `initAll` function to initialise all the components. For example:

```html
<body>
  ...
  <script src="<YOUR-JAVASCRIPT-FOLDER>/ogcio-ds.js"></script>
  <script>
    window.GOVIEFrontend.initAll();
  </script>
</body>
```

Run your application and check it works the same way as the Design System accordion example, by selecting the buttons and checking the accordion shows and hides sections.

In your live application:

- You must use `initAll` to initialise all components that use Gov IE DS JavaScript, or some components will not work correctly for disabled users who use assistive technologies

We recommend <Link href='?path=/docs/docs-import-css-assets-and-javascript--docs#import-javascript'>using an automated task or your build pipeline</Link> instead of copying the files manually

You can now get the full code for page layouts and other components from this website.
