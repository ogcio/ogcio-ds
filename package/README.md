# OGCIO-DS


OGCIO-DS contains the code you need to start building a user interface for government platforms and services.

## Contact the team

If you want to know more about OGCIO-DS, you can go to the [Contact us](https://www.design-system.ogcio.gov.ie/contact/) page.

## Quick start

There are 2 ways to start using OGCIO-DS components in your app.

Once installed, you will be able to use the code from the examples in the OGCIO-DS in your service.

### 1. Install with npm (recommended)

We recommend [installing OGCIO-DS using node package manager
(npm)](https://storybook.design-system.ogcio.gov.ie/?path=/docs/docs-install-with-npm--page).

### 2. Install using compiled files

You can also install OGCIO-DS by [copying our CSS, JavaScript and asset files into your project](https://storybook.design-system.ogcio.gov.ie/?path=/docs/docs-install-using-precompiled-files--page).


## Accessibility

The OGCIO-DS team works hard to ensure that OGCIO-DS is accessible.

Using Frontend will help your service meet [level AA of WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/). But you must still check that your service meets accessibility requirements, especially if you extend or modify components.

You should also use:

- [the JavaScript from OGCIO-DS](https://storybook.design-system.ogcio.gov.ie/?path=/story/docs-import-css-assets-and-javascript--page/#import-javascript)
- [a separate stylesheet](https://storybook.design-system.ogcio.gov.ie/?path=/story/docs-support-internet-explorer-8--page) if you support Internet Explorer 8

You can also read the [accessibility statement for OGCIO-DS](https://www.design-system.ogcio.gov.ie/accessibility/)
