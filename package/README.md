# GOV.IE Frontend 
=====================

OGCIO-DS contains the code you need to start building a user interface
for government platforms and services.

## Quick start

There are 2 ways to start using OGCIO-DS Frontend in your app.

Once installed, you will be able to use the code from the examples in the
gov.ie Design System in your service.

### 1. Install with npm (recommended)

We recommend [installing OGCIO-DS using node package manager
(npm)](https://github.com/ogcio/ogcio-ds/pkgs/npm/ogcio-ds).

### 2. Install using compiled files

You can also install GOV.IE Frontend by [copying our CSS, JavaScript and asset
files into your project](https://github.com/ogcio/ogcio-ds/tree/main/dist).

1. Access the pre-compiled files in our [repo](https://github.com/ogcio/ogcio-ds/tree/main/dist/@ogcio/)
2. Copy the assets folder to the root of your project’s public folder, so that for example `<YOUR-SITE-URL>/assets/logo-full.png` shows the `logo-full.png` image in your users’ browsers.
3. Copy the 2 .css files to a stylesheets folder in the root of your project’s public folder, so that for example `<YOUR-SITE-URL>/stylesheets/ogcio-ds-<VERSION-NUMBER>.min.css` shows the CSS file in your users’ browsers.
4. Copy the .js file to a JavaScript folder in the root of your project’s public folder, so that for example `<YOUR-SITE-URL>/javascript/ogcio-ds-<VERSION-NUMBER>.min.js` shows the JavaScript file in your users’ browsers.

## Accessibility

The GOV.UK Design System team works hard to ensure that GOV.IE Frontend is accessible.

Using Frontend will help your service meet [level AA of WCAG 2.1](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/understanding-wcag). But you must still [check that your service meets accessibility requirements](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/making-your-service-accessible-an-introduction), especially if you extend or modify components.

You should also use:

- [the JavaScript from GOV.IE Frontend](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/importing-css-assets-and-javascript/#javascript)
- [a separate stylesheet](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/supporting-ie8/) if you support Internet Explorer 8

Your service will not meet level AA of WCAG 2.1 if you use [compatibility mode](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/compatibility-mode/) to use GOV.IE Frontend with old frameworks or the old colour palette.

You can also read the [accessibility statement for the GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/accessibility/). -->
