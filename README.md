GOV.IE Frontend Â·
=====================

GOV.IE Frontend contains the code you need to start building a user interface
for government platforms and services.

<!-- See live examples of GOV.IE Frontend components, and guidance on when to use
them in your service, in the [GOV.UK Design
System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/). -->

## Quick start

There are 2 ways to start using GOV.IE Frontend in your app.

Once installed, you will be able to use the code from the examples in the
GOV.UK Design System in your service.

### 1. Install with npm (recommended)

We recommend [installing GOV.IE Frontend using node package manager
(npm)](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/installing-with-npm/).

### 2. Install using compiled files

You can also install GOV.IE Frontend by [copying our CSS, JavaScript and asset
files into your project](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/install-using-precompiled-files/).

## Browser and assistive technology support

GOV.IE Frontend supports:

- [recommended browsers](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/designing-for-different-browsers-and-devices#browsers-to-test-in)
- [recommended assistive technologies](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/testing-with-assistive-technologies#which-assistive-technologies-to-test-with)
- Internet Explorer 8, 9 and 10, although components may not look perfect
- your users overriding colours in Windows, Firefox and Chrome

## Accessibility

The GOV.UK Design System team works hard to ensure that GOV.IE Frontend is accessible.

Using Frontend will help your service meet [level AA of WCAG 2.1](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/understanding-wcag). But you must still [check that your service meets accessibility requirements](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/making-your-service-accessible-an-introduction), especially if you extend or modify components.

You should also use:

- [the JavaScript from GOV.IE Frontend](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/importing-css-assets-and-javascript/#javascript)
- [a separate stylesheet](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/supporting-ie8/) if you support Internet Explorer 8

Your service will not meet level AA of WCAG 2.1 if you use [compatibility mode](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/compatibility-mode/) to use GOV.IE Frontend with old frameworks or the old colour palette.

You can also read the [accessibility statement for the GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/accessibility/).
